The Digital Public Goods Alliance is a multi-stakeholder UN-endorsed initiative that facilitates the discovery and deployment of open-source technologies, bringing together countries and organisations to create a thriving global ecosystem for digital public goods and helping to achieve the sustainable development goals.

The DPGA is governed by a board, which functions as a strategic decision-making and oversight body for the DPGA Secretariat. The board consists of member-organisations who demonstrate a strong commitment to digital public goods and are committed to supporting the DPGAâ€™s mission and mandate. Current board members include the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), EkStep Foundation; the Government of Sierra Leone, the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad), UNDP, and UNICEF.
