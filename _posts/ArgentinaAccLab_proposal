## Proposal from Argentina´s Accelerator Lab 

Our lab has been at the forefront of citizen science, having mapped and built a federal platform for 
citizen science projects in collaboration with the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation. In 2024, our focus is on enhancing this platform to streamline information discovery and sharing for citizen scientists. Additionally, we are planning a data visualization contest. This contest aims to improve access to diverse datasets, stimulate innovation in data visualization techniques, and foster collaboration among various stakeholders. By leveraging the power of data visualization, we can amplify the impact and reach of citizen science efforts, facilitating broader participation and deeper insights into critical societal and environmental issues, while promoting a culture of open data. There are several datasets available, but often they are underutilized due to accessibility challenges such as scattered information across different government websites. We intend to collaborate with the Innovation Secretary to address these issues and make datasets more accessible to the community. Only in this way, isolated datasets can become "Digital Public Goods." Through initiatives like tutorials, webinars, and art and data festivals, we aim to equip citizens with the tools they need  to utilize and interpret data effectively. For instance, we'll explore positive deviance cases, such as identifying towns in Argentina with low carbon emissions per capita and examining the factors contributing to their success or searching for communities with positive mental health indicators to uncover the underlying factors driving their well-being.  Moreover, Argentina is an agroexporting country with vast agricultural data and satellite information available. We aim to harness these resources more effectively to derive meaningful insights and drive sustainable practices in agriculture and land management. Overall, our goal is to empower citizens to engage meaningfully with data and contribute to informed decision-making and positive social change.
